    "The bumblebee in flowers bright,\nBusy buzzing from dawn to night,\nIn its toil, there’s pure delight,\nNature’s worker, a wondrous sight.",
    "The mountain stream, a crystal flow,\nThrough rocky paths, it finds its glow,\nIn its journey, we come to know,\nLife’s twists and turns help us grow.",
    "The ladybug on a leaf of green,\nA tiny traveler, often unseen,\nIn its spots, a life serene,\nA small wonder, a nature’s queen.",
    "The lion roars in the African plain,\nA mighty call through sun and rain,\nIn its strength, we break our chain,\nTo find our courage, to ease our pain.",
    "The cherry blossoms bloom in spring,\nA fleeting beauty, a tender thing,\nIn their petals, hearts take wing,\nA celebration, a song to sing.",
    "A whisper of wind through the trees,\nA gentle sway, a calming breeze,\nIn its breath, all worries cease,\nNature’s lullaby brings peace."
